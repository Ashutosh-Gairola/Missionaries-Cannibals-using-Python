# Missionaries-Cannibals-using-Python
Implement a basic state space search (BFS) program in Python to solve the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle. The goal is to implement a simple program that finds a sequence of valid moves to safely transport three missionaries and three cannibals across a river, following specific constraints.
